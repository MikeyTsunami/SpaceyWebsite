Steps to pull from master to local files and then push to personal repo:

enjoy

git remote add upstream https://github.com/SpaceyDevs/SpaceyWebsite.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
git add .
git commit
git remote add myrepo https://github.com/(your github account)/SpaceyWebsite.git
git push myrepo master (upstream and myrepo are essentially variable names so if they are saved to the wrong repo you can try using a different name. I am Unaware of how to reset those at this time)
